A Post-Mortem by pb4
Codingame challenge - March/April 2020  

# Introduction:

  

Ocean of Code is a multiplayer AI contest proposed on the Codingame platform from Friday the 20th of March to Monday the 20th of April 2020. It is based on the board game Captain Sonar and requires manoeuvring your submarine with a delicate balance of staying active while remaining stealthy.

  

At the beginning, I was hooked on the challenge of implementing a proper system to track the opponent. In the early days, this was enough to climb all the way up the leaderboard. From that moment on, my fate was clear: I was going to spend one month trying to improve this AIâ€¦

  

# First versions and game analysis

  

Over the duration of the contest, I have written 8 major versions of my AI. Here is the breakdown of how they behaved, how they influenced my vision of the correct strategy and hence, how I prioritized features for my final version.

The **first version** was purely reactive and based on simple sequential  greedy rules:
-   Move to the closest cells, stay in the biggest chamber   
-   Shoot the opponent if the damage probability is sufficient
-   Place a mine randomly any time I can    
-   Silence 0 if the opponent can shoot me
-   Trigger mines if the probability is sufficient
    
The **second and third versions** were able to *group move and torpedo actions together* if the opponent could be brought in range with a single movement. However, *this move-to-shoot logic was susceptible to close off a large area of the map*.

The **fourth version** *prioritized stealthiness over shooting*. Games were long, but would often be lost when the map is filled with the submarine's previous path: remaining hidden proves impossible when space is cramped, and I would lose in torpedo fights. At some point, *it is important to balance stealthiness with aggressiveness*.

By this time, moving with the sole objective to stay stealthy was a declining strategy as most players started to use mines efficiently. Movement was now a difficult trade-off between:
- Keeping big chambers available (tron-like)
- Staying stealthy
- Avoiding mines
- Approaching the opponent to shoot

My **fifth and sixth version** were (failed) attempts at integrating the four criteria above into greedy rule-based logic in one single decision step. I *failed at balancing* correctly all aspects together.

The **seventh version** was acceptable, it balanced movement correctly and had a strong late-game but *often lost during forced engagements where the opponent had taken the initiative*.

At this point, I was ready to write my **eighth and final version** based on the strategy below.

 # Strategy
As of writing this PM, I have come to the conclusion that captain sonar must be played as two mini-games in one.
1) A space-filling game where you must claim the most surface area to out-survive the opponent in the late game
2) A waiting game where you must **at any time be ready** if the opponent finds and engages your submarine

Obviously, this assumes decent fighting logic as soon as both submarines are close to each other and revealed.

While point #2 may seem obvious, its direct implication is that **torpedo and silence charges must be conserved at all times**. Hence, **it is of utmost importance to use Silence as sparingly as possible**.  The only valid reasons to use Silence would be to avoid the opponent's mine field, or preemptively evade an unfavorable engagement where the opponent will shoot you and you can not retaliate. Even if a submarine gets the first torpedo shot, it will be at a disadvantage if it needs to charge both Torpedo and Silence at the same time.

This approach introduces a new compromise to make:
> "I can Silence right now, the opponent has a medium chance to hit me.
> Should I silence away ?"

# Final version

  As explained above, the objective of this final version is to balance correctly the four actions Torpedo / Move / Silence / Surface and allow fine-tuned compromise between aggressive and defensive behaviors.
## Evaluation framework
In order to have a unified evaluation, all actions are evaluated in the framework of total discounted damage taken from or done to the opponent in the future.
- For a torpedo, it is simply the damage probability given the opponent presence map `damageProbability*0.95^0`
- For a surface, we take a known damage when surface happens and assume we'll need to surface again after `pathSize` turns : ``1*(0.95^turn + 0.95^(turn + pathSize)``
- For space-filling, `0.95^spaceLeft` : we will need to surface when all cells are filled in
- For a mine, the submarine takes `mineDamage*0.95^turn` damage when walking through a mine field. See below how mineDamage is calculated.

## Overall structure
The objective of the search is to evaluate nearly exhaustively all Surface / Move / Torpedo / Silence combinations.
The search is split in three consecutive steps:
1) For all Surface/Silence/Move combinations, evaluate the future damage I'll take from navigating the opponent's mine field and from my own surface
2) For all valid combinations from step 1, interleave a torpedo between all actions and evaluate the damage dealt to the opponent.
3) For all valid combinations from step 2, evaluate the opponent retaliation (ie: best torpedo) if he's allowed to move only, move/silence or surface/move/silence



## Step 1: Handling navigation through a minefield

The objective is to construct a list associating movement orders at turn 0 to future damage taken. To do this, for all initial Surface/Silence/Move combination, a Dijkstra search is launched looking for the cheapest way to move 5 tiles deep.

     Move at turn 0                           Future damage taken   Best move continuation
    {MOVE N SILENCE},                         0.055                 MOVE E | MOVE E | MOVE S
    {SURFACE,MOVE N SILENCE},                 1.055                 MOVE E | MOVE E | MOVE S
    {MOVE E SILENCE},                         0.045                 MOVE E | MOVE S | MOVE S
    {SURFACE,MOVE E SILENCE},                 1.045                 SURFACE | MOVE E | MOVE S
    {MOVE S SILENCE},                         invalid               MOVE N | MOVE E | MOVE S
    {SURFACE,MOVE S SILENCE},                 1.000                 ...
    {MOVE W SILENCE},                         0.333                 ...
    {SURFACE,MOVE W SILENCE},                 1.333                 ...
    {MOVE N SILENCE,SILENCE N 0},             0.055                 ...
    {SURFACE,MOVE N SILENCE,SILENCE N 0},     1.055                 ...
    {MOVE N SILENCE,SILENCE N 1},             invalid               ...
    {SURFACE,MOVE N SILENCE,SILENCE N 1}      invalid               ...
    ...   (144 lines)                         ...                   ...

  
Calculation for "future damage taken" is shown below.
Other players have explained in detail how it is possible to generate a mine presence probability map such as the following one:

        0   0   0   0   0   0
        0   X   0   0   0   0
        0   0   0   25  0   0
        0   12  37  0   25  0
        12  12  12  37  0   0
        0   12  12  0   0   0
        0   0   0   0   0   0

The future damage taken is evaluated assuming all mines are "auto-triggered" if the submarine is within range.
As an example, assuming the submarine start in position X on the diagram above:


    MOVE S  : trigger all mines marked 'a', this is (12+37)*0.95^0 damage
        0   0   0   0   0   0
        a   X   a   0   0   0
        a   a   a   25  0   0
        a   a   a   0   25  0
        12  12  12  37  0   0
        0   12  12  0   0   0
        0   0   0   0   0   0
        
    MOVE S  : trigger all mines marked 'b', this is (12+12+12)*0.95^1 more damage
        0   0   0   0   0   0
        a   X   a   0   0   0
        a   a   a   25  0   0
        a   a   a   0   25  0
        b   b   b  37  0   0
        0   12  12  0   0   0
        0   0   0   0   0   0
        
    MOVE E  : trigger all mines marked 'c', this is (37+25)*0.95^2 more damage
        0   0   0   0   0   0
        a   X   a   0   0   0
        a   a   a   c   0   0
        a   a   a   c   25  0
        b   b   b   c   0   0
        0   12  12  0   0   0
        0   0   0   0   0   0
        
    MOVE N  : trigger all mines marked 'd', this is (0)*0.95^3 more damage
        0   0   0   0   0   0
        a   X   a   d   0   0
        a   a   a   c   0   0
        a   a   a   c   25  0
        b   b   b   c   0   0
        0   12  12  0   0   0
        0   0   0   0   0   0

    SURFACE  : this is (1)*0.95^4 more damage
        0   0   0   0   0   0
        a   X   a   d   0   0
        a   a   a   c   0   0
        a   a   a   c   25  0
        b   b   b   c   0   0
        0   12  12  0   0   0
        0   0   0   0   0   0


## Step 2

Try to interleave a torpedo between all action and evaluate the probability to damage the opponent.

    Move at turn 0                           Future damage taken   Damage dealt to opp
    {MOVE N SILENCE},                        0.055                 0.0
    {TORPEDO,MOVE N SILENCE},                0.055                 0.8
    {MOVE N SILENCE,TORPEDO},                0.055                 1.5
    {SURFACE,MOVE N SILENCE},                1.055                 0.0
    {SURFACE,TORPEDO,MOVE N SILENCE},        1.055                 0.8
    {SURFACE,MOVE N SILENCE,TORPEDO},        1.055                 1.3
    ...   (568 lines)                        ...                   ...

## Step 3

A torpedo sent might reveal the position of the submarine. The probability of being damaged by the opponent is calculated assuming there is an equal chance for the opponent's presence in all positions of his presence map and the opponent will play aggressively (i.e.: move and torpedo if in range, even if he enters a mine field).

    Move at turn 0                           Future damage taken   Damage dealt to opp   Retaliation by opp
    {MOVE N SILENCE},                        0.055                 0.0                   1.0
    {MOVE N SILENCE,TORPEDO},                0.055                 1.5                   2.0
    {TORPEDO,MOVE N SILENCE},                0.055                 0.8                   2.0
    {SURFACE,MOVE N SILENCE},                1.055                 0.0                   1.5
    {SURFACE,TORPEDO,MOVE N SILENCE},        1.055                 0.8                   0.0
    {SURFACE,MOVE N SILENCE,TORPEDO},        1.055                 1.3                   0.0
    ...   (568 lines)                        ...                   ...                   ...

My retaliation to the opponent's torpedo is also evaluated to find situations where it is possible to wait for a better torpedo on the next turn.

## Final action chosen
In the end, the action chosen is the one that minimizes `futureDamageTakenFromMines - damageDealtToOpponent + damageReceivedFromOpponentRetaliation`.

Some key advantages of this search are:
- In extreme cases, the search remains well-behaved and insensitive to edge-cases:
--- If the opponent position is known with 100% certainty, the algorithm behaves like a **3-ply deep minimax**, for efficient fighting.
--- If the opponent position is not known, the algorithm behaves like a **5-ply deep space-filling-mine-avoiding** algorithm
--- In between, the search is able to balance both requirements
- It is possible to **balance aggressiveness, mine evasion, torpedo avoidance and silence usage**
- Silence may be tuned to "jump" over mine fields and evade incoming torpedoes: this fits the strategic objective to minimize silence usage overall
- Ability to find **natively all types of combinations** within the same framework, and to **combine objectives** such as using surface + silence away to both avoid a torpedo and not enter a minefield


## Tweaks

In no particular order, a large amount of tweaks were added to tune the evaluation function.

- The silence cost is largely reduced if a torpedo was launched
- Favor Move after Torpedo
- Favor hugging walls
- Decrease perceived damage taken from mines if I am sufficiently stealth
- I'm sorry there are so many I won't list them all here...

## Other actions
Basic implementation everywhere which was reused from early versions of my bot. I never saw the need to improve on those.
### Mine
If you have enough charges and you can lay a mine with more than 3 new spots hit, lay the mine.
If you have full charges everywhere, lay a random mine anyway.
### Trigger
Upon choosing a Torpedo/Surface/Silence/Move combination with the main algorithm, try to interleave a trigger everwhere between each action.
If the damage probability is sufficient, use the trigger action.
The threshold is adaptive depending on the overlap with other mines.
### Sonar
If between 40% and 60% of the opponent's positions are within a single sector, Sonar this sector.

# What worked...

## 1) Respect the opponent
You are in Legend, your opponent too, his bot is at least half-decent. Assume the opponent plays well. Consequently, there is little chance he is standing right over your mines.
With this logic, I filtered out as many locations as possible from my tracker where the opponent was sitting on my mines.

Direct effects:
- Instead of 2.5 triggers per game, I went down to 1.3 triggers per game
- Damage dealt with mines per game was stable around 0.9, despite triggering far less mines
- Since less mines are triggered, you maintain control over more territory
- Approximately +3 score on the CG leaderboard

Indirect effect:
- In the endgame, this assumes the opponent doesn't enter your territory. Hence he's further from you, and less considered a threat: it is easier to conserve Silence charges for actual necessary evasion or instakill combinations.

## 2) Tweak, tweak, tweak...
After 8 major versions and a LOT of minor versions, my code had become bloated with features that *should* work but whose effect I was never able to ascertain.

At this point, I decided to spend some time tweaking my evaluation coefficients and found very large gains, going from 40% winrate against a fixed panel of opponents to 50% winrate against that same panel.

For example, allowing torpedoes with a 90% hitrate instead of 100% was a net +2 score on the CG leaderboard.  This precise change had been ineffective on earlier iterations of my code, but it proved largely positive at the end of the contest.

## 3) Dual tracker system
It is acceptable to assume the opponent will not launch a torpedo or trigger a mine that will damage him. However, it is not safe in terms of tracking: you might end up with absolutely no possibilities remaining.

I maintained at all times two trackers:
- one "safe" making no assumption
- one "unsafe" making reasonable assumptions

If at any point in time the unsafe tracker returned no possible position, it would by default be reverted to the "safe" tracker values and resume from there.

The "unsafe" tracker could have included logic such as "*If the opponent had been here, he would have used a torpedo on me. I know he hasn't, so he mustn't have been there.*", but I never took the time to implement such logic.

# ... and what didn't
## 1) Intuition
At first I adjusted the coefficients according to my understanding of the game, with limited results.

I then switched to a systematic approach with CGBenchmark with the objective of maximizing observed winrate, and it worked a lot better.

I am still **highly** surprised with the final constants, showing I don't understand the game as much as I thought...

For example, the value of the opponent's torpedo is 3.5x lower than the value of a silence. This means he must launch 2 torpedoes dealing 2 damage each for an evading Silence to be "worth it".

*I don't get it. And I never will. But it works....*

## 2) Mixing codes
There are 3 codes on my computer : V61.cpp, V93.cpp and V117.cpp which seem to perform remarkably well on CGBenchmark, despite using vastly different evaluation methods and assumptions about the opponent.
- V61 assumes the opponent used Silence for the shortest distance or the shortest distance + 1, and is subsequently extra agressive.
- V93 values stealth and staying away from the opponent, at the cost of very inefficient space-filling
- V117 is my final submitted version, somewhat balanced

Several attempts were made to combine the strengths of V61 with V93 or other codes, systematically resulting in a weaker hybrid version.

*"Rich person problem: I don't know which cool AI to choose from!"*

## 3) Area 51
At some point in the game, the opponent has placed so many mines you DO NOT WANT to venture in that area, even with a Silence.

When approaching such a minefield, my AI would natively recognize this and turn back.

However, upon turning back it would go and hug the wall, effectively creating two disting chambers within my territory. Indeed, in terms of evaluating the "spaceLeft", the other chamber was still accessible by walking into the opponent's minefield!

I implemented many ~~solutions~~ to this problem,   only to see them fail one by one. Soft discouragement, hard interdiction, nothing would be enough to correct this late-game behavior.

This ties us back to #1) Intuition:

*It should work. But it didn't...*

## 4) Adaptive early/mid/late game behavior
I would have loved to include various behavioral patterns depending on the recognized stage of the game.

Stealth mine laying early game, fast whole map coverage mid game, efficient space-filling and avoidance late game.

*I tried... I swear I tried, every other day.... It. Just. Wouldn't. Work!*
# Conclusion
Loved the game, though I'm not sure my family liked it as much during those 4 longs weeks.

I actually am surprised that I liked the game this much, I had strongly voted against this exact game during our Mean Max brainstorming sessions.

Thanks to the creators for making this possible.
